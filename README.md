# HTML Basics Exploration 🧑‍💻✨

Today’s learning focused on gaining a foundational understanding of **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** — the backbone of web development. 
I explored:

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **HTML Basics** – Structure, syntax, and core principles.
- **Applications of HTML** – How it's used to create web pages and structure content online.
- **Tag Properties** – Differences between structural and formatting elements.

## 🏷️ Tags Explored
I worked with and compared various commonly used tags, including:
- `<p>` – Paragraph
- `<b>`, `<strong>` – Bold text (visual vs. semantic)
- `<i>`, `<em>` – Italics and emphasis
- `<small>` – Smaller text
- `<sub>`, `<sup>` – Subscript and superscript
- `<u>` – Underlined text

## 🔬 Hands-on Practice
I wrote a mini HTML document that included all the above tags to:
- Compare how they render in a browser
- Understand their purpose and best-use cases
- Observe the difference between semantic and stylistic tags

## 📝 What’s Next
I'll build on this foundation by exploring:
- Lists, links, and images
- Page layout using `<div>` and `<span>`
- Introduction to CSS for styling
